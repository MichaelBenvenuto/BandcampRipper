## Why tho?
So i made this because i was bored and needed to learn python for work, so i wrote something that rips the low quality song previews from bandcamp, and it works pretty well.
I wrote this about 9 months ago (Around October of 2018) and so far i've used it a couple times __testing purposes only__.

## Hey, this is actually important
I would like to mention that this is for educational purposes only and is not to be used for any illegal activity. Use this at your own risk, i am not responsible for anything you get yourself into :)

## Usage
Pretty simple actually, you're a big dummy if you can't understand :angry:

Firstly, navigate to the directory of this script using whatever command does that on your system, mine is `cd`
```
This is just an example you silly willy

cd /whatever/blahblahblah/ohmygod/pythonscripts
```

Then run the script using python

```
python ./ripper.py
```

*BUT WAIT*

You need to add at least one of the following arguments:

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`-d`| Downloads all songs from an artist|
|`-a`| Downloads all songs from an album|
|`both -d and -a`| This actually defaults to -d, you'll need to specify a link to an artist's bandcamp page, otherwise it will crash|

__This also downloads and tags the mp3 files with the appropriate title, artist, album art, etc. as long as mutagen is added to your libraries__
